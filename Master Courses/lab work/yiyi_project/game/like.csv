"What are things you like about LoL (e.g., honor system, fancy skins, etc...)?"
just dueling other people
Different ways of winning
"I like the game, doing good, and playing with friends"
I hate this game but I'm addicted please help I can't stop playing
"Honor system, fancy skins, frequency of the releasing of new champions so the game always has someone new. Really strategical like a MOBA game should be. Graphics are just the way they should be, not bad and not excessively beautiful."
skins also the system. I like moba in general.
"Skins, Gameplay, Becoming better, Champions, Learning the game"
just gameplay
Being able to learn and play a champion I enjoy successfully in order to help my team.
"Nothing "
"I really like that it's a team game and that you get to play with some real cool people. "
"The skins, The Honor system works but not good enough though to help with the toxic playerbase."
The gameplay used to allow skilled players a chance to shine and it is good at killing hours.
"Urgot, Urgot, Urgot, Urgot and Urgot... Oh, and Qiyana."
"voice lines "
"I like how playing certain champions adjusts my mood and music taste. If I play Gangplank, listening to Sabaton will not only make me play better, but also makes it better to listen to on its own."
"Characters such as darius, diana, veigar etc."
"The lore, the styles of gameplay, being able to mess around and have fun with friends."
Fun gameplay
everything except players giving up
Champion and skin lore; sometimes game mechanics.
The characters and lore
"Certain champs. That's it. As of right now, everyone plays either of not having any alternatives, being addicted or clinging on that small hope of everything becoming better. I have lost hope and have recently also kind of stopped playing."
"The characters, lore and game itself"
"The diversity of champions, lores, and skins."
Good time passer
"The pure skill uninfluenced by the ability to buy power, levels of complexity to the game, incredible amounts of strategy, the competition, lore and art, and just catching fun games with friends every once in a while"
Playing with friends. And twisted treelines
"Skins, friends, ranking up"
Nami
"The skins are nice, as is the honor system, though it doesn't have much purpose other than to keep people from getting ranked rewards. I definitely like the boxes they came out with that give you free skin/champ/ward shards."
The Themes and Lore
The core gameplay.
its relaxing (when people arent toxic)
"diversity, uniqueness, and variability"
It's variety of champs and options to play
master yi
"skins, winning"
"competition, gameplay creativity (skills, builds, team comps)"
The variety of ways to play.
"Lore and world, most champions, more laid back than other MOBAs like DOTA2"
"Skins and new champions "
I like the gameplay and playing with non-toxic players.
I don't play the game that much anymore as I feel that there isn't much left to like but recently I took a bit more interest in the lore.
"Macro play, shot calling, predictions "
The game play and playing with friends. I try hard every game but at the end i just wanna have fun so i try my heart out and live with the outcome. I love the wide variety in champs and sometimes even the unbalance as it is humorous to see a true shit show clown fiesta game. Every match is diffrent some peopple chat some meme and some just silently carry its unpredictable and that randomness is fun i love rng which is why i play hearthstone too. This game has so many ups and a high skill floor so it feels like a gated community just to not suck.
Gameplay. Most other things are just nice to have add-ons.
skins
"i dont, i spent 700â‚¬ on it, it's too late to go back, just play it so i can atleast feel like my money isn't totally wasted"
"I like the feeling of improving and reaching higher ranks, or simply using ARAMS to kill time is quite nice."
the game itself
"Skins, Lore, Art, Music, "
"Honestly, not much any more.  Used to be a great, strategic and competetive game 10 years ago.  Been a raging dumpsterfire of hyper-monetization, power/mobility/damage creep, and shitty balance decisions since the middle of Season 5, and has only been getting steadily and increasingly worse over the last 5 years.  RIP Morello, Guinsoo, Tiamat, Randuin, (Dark)Shurelia, and Xypherous, the RIOTers who actually played their own game and gave a shit about things like ""design philosophy,"" ""clarity,"" ""burden of knowledge,"" ""counterplay,"" and actual balance and parity between classes.  You will be, and have been missed."
the game itself
"Skins are amazing but overpriced imo. Client sucks, matching making sucks, balance sucks. Honor system is useless."
fancy skins
honor system; new champions
Not pay to win
"Its a popular game. Game is trash and unfun since runes reforged was introduced, but ranking up in it is the only fun thing now."
"Playing with friends, the artwork, the unique characters and lore (so much so I run a DnD campaign based on the world of Runeterra)"
"I like having a game I used to be able to enjoy with friends. Now all I have is a multinational corporate conglomerate behind the wheel trying to squeeze every last penny from it. In other words, it fucking sucks"
honor system
"Akali. "
Gameplay strategy champions
"I like the variety in gameplay and a clear progression forward, easy to point out mistakes and learn how to overcome them to get better"
I like mastering the game and showing off my rank
The game itself ðŸ¤£
"skins, fucking around with friends is always fun"
"NOTHING "
i like the skins they make
Challenge. Constant change. Large amount of playstyles.
Not much to like these last days. I miss season 5 and before
"Gameplay, aesthetic, lore"
URF
Beating other players
Shit players and shit meta
Skins I think
"uh i like the runes, skins are real good too, (so long as they pamper to my champs uwu) and i fuckin love the lore. idk if i'd still be playing, if it weren't for my undying love for the characters."
Skins
"The visual effects, splash arts, Camille, and their cinematic videos "
"Playing with friends and messing around is a heck of a good time "
honor system and ranks
Getting keys for free but everything else is shit
"I like the Championdesigns including the visual ingame outcome, splashart, the voice actors/actress work as well as the lore behind the champ and the great skin designs also i pretty much like the community because i made very good experience and toxicity is more rare than common to me"
"I love the interactive devs, the skins, and the nice side of the community!"
"Unique champion abilities, lore, skins"
"the mixture of macro(map) and micro play(champion) makes for a more interesting experience "
"All of it. Wish there were separate honor and MVP systems, since Honor is treated like an MVP system the majority of the time. "
Fancy skins and playing with friends.
"I love the beautiful art in league of legends. The characters (Akali, Neeko, Lux, Swain, Morg/Kayle, etc.) that have beautiful voicelines I could listen to forever. A lot of the artists in the community too, make it really worth it. "
the probability that the game may once go back to its glory days of season 4
Nothing.
"Variety of characters, loot system is alright, skins are usually good, and the fanart and stories are wonderful as well as the actual lore. "
Competitiviness
"PvE Game Modes, GOOD events and skins"
Cinematics cause its the only thing riot can get right as a company.
Competitive nature of the game
I like that it's the few games I can play on my crappy computer
"the competitive aspect, odessey mode (pve-modes in general), Lore if they didnÂ´t rewrite it all the time"
bard
simple gameplay with enjoyable champions
Skins and getting to play with friends
I love all the beautiful skins and I love being able to play with friends
"Being able to play with a few friends who don't get toxic. "
"gameplay, cute things (little legens, teemo ecc.)"
"Competitive "
I like the competitive nature of the game and being rewarded for doing well.
"I really like the moba 5v5 playstyle and the hundreds of champions you can play as. It's a game that in itself is very simple to play, but hard to master. That's my favorite kind of game style."
"Epicgamerz skillz , and the fact that i spent more money on that game , than on my 3kâ‚¬ computer i play it on."
skins
It's a time waster.
The skins.
i like the general concept but not the way its executed
nothing really
skins(the art team!!!) and music (I'm looking at u k/da ;D)
"Honor system, champ variety, lore"
the champs that I played a lot over the years
The game is fun and i have awesome memories of playing with my brother and friends.
"Skins are great, winning is great, rotating game modes were great but they are gone now."
"Gameplay, social aspects of the game"
A lot of unique characters. I really liked when rotating gamemodes and Nexus Blitz were a thing.
"Lore, champions feel unique and inspired"
the old days
"Honestly, I'm pretty sure I only play this game to prove to people that I can and for the dopamine.  I think about this every once in a while and I don't really know why exactly I play, but I do."
"The cool skins, and the champions are very unique and fun to play"
"Mostly the champions I play. Skins are cool, but not necessarily what I like the most"
Parts of the game you don't have to constantly pay for
fancy skin
The lore. And the gameplay itself 'cause I think it's really fun and enjoyable. It's just the toxicity that can make it bad.
Community. I have met a lot of kind people.
"At the moment. Nothing. Rank is a shit show and thats the only thing that I play. Skins are coming off being greedy and I just don't buy them anymore (Preistege skins, Eternals coming out soon etc.) I used love skins. "
"The fact that i can meat a lot of new people here, also the storys they have for champs and skin lines"
Strategic gameplay
"its fun when you play it with friends, in a not serious mood"
Most of the champion designs along with the skillcap required to play each champion.
Character originality.
Its a go to game. whenever my friend and I have absolutely have nothing to do.
"I like interacting with my friend "
"Strategy, interaction with friends, skill progression"
Its ecosystem
"It's free. It hits every kind of fantasy in all of it's characters. Lore and game play wise. Skins a re cool too. "
The strategy part and the teamwork
How fun Aatrox is and having fun with my friends and Girlfriend
Quality of cosmetics; Gameplay itself; Being open to playing the way you yourself want
"Gameplay, skins"
skins and friends
Champ Design and Lore
"Skins, honoring, making friends, very well made and thought out game, constantly changing with patches, all around fun."
"Skins (not the price but the content). Updates on kits, character model/design, mainly the artistic side of LoL."
"Removing the individual loading timers on loading screen, players cannot single out and harass individuals for that anymore."
"I like the gameplay mostly. I really like TFT mode. Also, the pretty skins are nice."
"Great characters, art, lore and gameplay."
Cool champions
The gameplay loop
Is fun and makes you think strategically
Its Fun to play And im Ok at it.
"The gameplay, the lore, the game is great and some games are awesome but the community (and most streamers) are so toxic/garbo "
i like that it used to be a fun skillfull game
the variety of characters
"Incredible videos, Interesting lore and just a generally fun game with fun mechanics."
Old lore. The gameplay (35min game with no assasins). DEEMAACIAA!
Mostly gameplay before season 8. now mostly losing interest everytime I play a match unless it's RGM
Short games. A variety of champions and playstyles means the game doesn't get stale quickly.
The large unique roster
"Lore, gameplay"
nice game mechanics in general
"Shyvana, the rare strategy based games. Some skins."
Full AD Sion Support
The game play
a playstyle for everybody
An ever changing gameplay.  I feel there needs to be less of a focus on all these money making schemes for skins/etc/etc and more focus on balance and additional gamemodes to mix things up a bit.
"After playing for so many years in such toxic environment, and being slightly competitive (hence taking the game more serious than anyone should ever take it if not going to become a pro), it's really hard for me to say something specific about league that I like. To be honest, it's more like an addiction than something I really like to do. Most of the time, I won't play it because I want to, but rather because I can't stop playing it, since, as I said, it's an addiction. But one of the few things I still enjoy (sometimes) is playing with my friends (at least, those who still play it) and with my main, Sona."
"Character design definetely ! "
"champion variety "
Making new friends
it's fun.
"I used to like and respect their free to play model alongside a balanced and fun game. Now it's just a shitshow of season passes, prestige skins, emotes, ward skins, little legends, borders, icons and who knows what else. That would be fine if the game wasn't a ridiculous unbalanced mess with only the most recent champions seeing play because they're straight up powercreep over the old ones."
"The option of Choice in all decisions, from champion choice, to lane choice, to choosing how to play that character. Could go on and on."
skins
"Charcters "
gameplay (this season kinda sucks through balancing and no new  GOOD gamemodes)
The competitive environment.
"Cosmetics, Honor System, Quests"
rank system
"Character Design, replayability, easy learning curve. great art and animations."
Skins... curious about the discussion of season 9 ranked being bad.
The lore.
"Skins and game modes (E.g. Urf, Hexakill, PoroKing, etc.)"
Not much to be honest
playing with friends
"Nothing. It's a gimmick that doesn't improve anything. "
Season 4
"Complexity, ability to be creative, many different playstyles/champions"
"It's fun, the whole game I enjoy. (Not sure about Eternals and I'm not super happy with emotes as they mostly get used to BM)"
"Competition "
"Nothing, game is trash but adictting"
"Skins, new announcers"
ARAM having a randomness to it.
Art and Champions
"I love collecting skins that I enjoy, I've met some amazing people that I've been friends with for years now through LoL, and I enjoy the gameplay sometimes."
Skins
"games with no toxicity to the point where everybody trolls and laughs, teamplays and outplays"
"Lore, characters and honor"
"Honestly, shockingly, it's the community, it's not as toxic as people make it out to be, when I had a working computer I'd only ever run into a toxic player every now and then and that'd be like once every 10 games."
only the core game
Skins; game strategy
Skins
Tbh I donâ€™t really like the honor system at all and I think that skins donâ€™t really matter.
Strategy
The champions
Not Much
Competativeness
gameplay
I enjoy the core gameplay when it's not a burst down meta and it actually is a team game where everyone needs to contribute.
Its free and i am good at it.
nothing anymore
Addiction
"cool skins, playing with friends"
"I enjoy how even if you play any one champion, there will still be some counter to it (although this seems to be changing with the recent reworks and new champ releases)."
Urf (because I can have fun without being judged and flamed).
Skins
"Being a free game that i can play with friends, now having a ability to get skins for free."
Almost solely the gameplay itself and how high the skill ceiling is on certain champs
"It is fun and competitive, and the more time that you put in the more rewards you get. The skins are nice, and if you enjoy a certain champion you can normally do well with them with enough practice."
at this point its a way to blow off steam
Pretty worthless to me
"The gameplay, mostly. The characters and visuals as well, they're just really neat and inventive (most of the time)."
Skins
i just like strategic games
"Used to like the Game Modes, but as you can see, even that's gone. So ... nothing."
The skins and champions mostly
I'd say the game itself
Free to play. BE for champs. Skins in hextech chests
I like mobas and League had the best combination of strategy and simplicity at the time I started playing.
"The characters. I wouldn't even touch this game if they didn't have masterpieces like Jhin and Camille. Some of the skins are okay. "
Nothing right now... I'm addicted
"Unfair and unmeasured, literally ruins my mood"
The characters and the moba genre
Lore of the characters and theoretically being able to improve skill over time
"I like the variety of characters and skins in a somewhat fantastical environment.  Also, no two games feel the same even though the objectives stay consistent (ex. bring down towers, dragon/Baron, nexus)"
I like that I play Taliyah and have a good time.
Great question
Nothing
"Nothing, there is nothing good about the game atm, Riot games seems to be very non connected with its player base which has caused issues accross the community"
"ranked system, rewards"
the emotes are pretty cool i guess
"Skins, championdesign"
"Old border, old client"
"Nothing, its trash"
Gameplay (with and without friends)
Honor System
"Cool skins, the story of the game, and the game modes that donâ€™t come back anymore "
not sure......maybe the moments i can actually play good or better than my opponent. just to confirm to myself i can still play games 'good'
Stacking
I like playing some champions and nothing else. I loved the game when I started in season 3 bot not now.
"playing as cute girls, definitely"
Balance Changes
Mindless fun
"story , skin , art , music"
"Skins, rank, champion diversity, skill expression"
"I love how league at its core focuses on skill, strategy and teamwork. The blend of these three makes for a very fun and addicting game. I'm also a very big fan of the cosmetics in the game. Especially the fact that they are too expensive (except the little legends, the loot box system is a disappointed and i would have absolutely thrown money at it if they sold each legend separately) and can even be earned for free if you play enough. The game isn't anywhere near pay to win and has a lot of systems in place to reward those who do play. Such as the honor systems, missions, etc. I would be lying if i haven't went on a gaming binge for a few hours just because of the rewards given for playing. I'm determined to get every poro icon that I can!"
"Not much to like about lol rn with well, you know everything going on"
innovation of gameplay and it's lore. I would also say PvE... but clearly eternals is more important then a gamemode that requires effort to make.
tryndamere lol
"Honour, skins for my mains that are worth the price, different modes, being able to play with my friends"
"honor system, skins, skill display, winning, working with others, unique champions"
"When managed properly it is an amazing game, very fun and unique for its genre "
"The F2P model, skins, game quality (excluding 9.14)"
Outplaying idiots
Nothing I'm just addicted please help
Only game i'm connected with ALL my friends
"ranks, loot, skilled play, high knowledge base"
I like creative skin concepts and playing with supports that can do something other than buffing/healing.
"I don't, its like cigerettes"
"Honor system is well designed in my opinion, skins are nice aswell"
"Honors, Skins and fun to play with friends."
"The game itself. At its core, LoL is a great game that is a ton of fun. But Riot has gone down hill over the last decade. Between Marc Merril retiring, and tencent buying them out, it's just been a shitshow for a long time."
"Skins are nice, some champs are fun to play, it's engaging most of the time."
"champions(the old ones,not the new ones, they are garbage champs that are overloaded with hypermobile kits that allow them to x y z )"
I used to like ranked but it became meaningless for me. I also enjoyed certain champions but they were reworked and their lores retconned into something unenjoyable. I dont like anything about league anymore
"the fact its free to play and has versatility to it, good to play with friends"
Most of the game
"Skins, nice players, being able to have something fun to do with my friends"
Art and music.
"The competitive aspect, clash, certain champions"
Skins. Gameplay before season 8
i don't really like anything about LoL anymore except the rotating game modes
"Learning new champs/mastering them especially uncommon  champs "
GAME
"Skins, Champion Design & Lore aswell as its cinematics."
Irelia is fun and only that. The game itself is bad.
rotating gamemodes and events
nothing
only the honor system
It's pretty easy to get into compared to other mobas
"The roster of fun characters to play is a huge reason I enjoy the game. The gameplay is super fun, but can get frustrating if you play too long."
The game a few years ago
azir
Zoe. The champion is a lot of fun and one of the two reasons I still play.
Playing 5 man's is with my friends
"Streamers, Tournaments, Community & Friends, Competition & Ranked"
"The music, videos, lore"
"Gameplay, certain champions"

I don't like it I'm just addicted
PROJECT skins and most characters are fun to play.
The honor system does not really matter
The game
competitiveness
The champions
Nothing anymore
I don't. It's dogshit
"Community, Is the fare the best and worst ive ever seen"
"the gameplay with infinite skill cap, the strategy side of the game, the satisfaction of winning because you played well."
"When i turbosmurf 1v9 low master scrubs and no better jungle snuset on enemy team + egirl whisper in my ear telling me im playing well good mental abuser akali nerfs, just the usual things."
"Nothing right now, honestly."
nothing
Skins for my favorite characters :D
"what is there to like?  Art team is turning to shit, balance team is actually getting paid to fuck up the game, and terrible decision making from the higher ups.  Literally nothing makes this game any fun lmao.  The thing that saves this game is the fact that it is harder to cheat in this game than it is in shooters.  Making it more competitive and fair than most other games."
"gameplay, skins, new champions, reworks"
champions
"Skins look cool, Lore is nice"
CSing
"The game itself, skins, TFT."
Singed and off m3ta picks
Keeping me entertained for a couple of hours
"Cool skins, playing with friends, making new friends"
Ranked skins Champs and Friends
"too large question, honor system is good, events used to be good, urf"
"i cant say what i like so ill say what i dont like the honor system, balancing league(almost always based on pro play which isnt good) , riot just wanting only money (eternals,skins etc.)punishment system and client in every way"
Getting better than my friends so I can talk shit to them
"Tbh, I don't really like LoL much anymore but have spent far too much money IRL on this game to simply throw it away. At this point i am waiting for a ban from Riot so i have a justified reason to stop playing league."
"Nothing much anymore, but previously the nuance and depth you could learn and develop with most champions. Off-meta builds and unorthodox methods of play were also very fun."
"Being able to play the game without needing to spend a dime, Overall competitive game which i like"
not much anymore
"nothing, the game sucks, theres no balance, its a cash grab run by retarded college dropouts"
Gameplay
"exept comunity the game is fine "
Having multiple builds/roles for champions
Teambased game and a lot of strategies and playstyles involved etc.. adc or splitpushers..
social experience
"Honor system, Skins, Obtaining chests for S and Lore."
"I enjoy the fair amount of strategy, game knowledge, and mechanical skill required. I enjoy playing with friends, receiving praise and praising others. Itâ€™s also nice supporting each other if anyone is having a bad game. Itâ€™s a generally nice bonding experience as long as I treat the game as a game,. I also like to be able to show off the skills Iâ€™ve learned throughout my experience via rank and outplays. The skins I buy are celebratory because I only buy skins on champions I enjoy playing."
"Lore, honour system, mastery system"
"The feeling of beating another person whilst looking cool(Pantheon, Mordekaiser, Aatrox, Urgot), outplays."
Honor system is rigged. Skins are cash crab. Riot is not making anything good atm. All autistic crap no one likes.
That it used to be good - the game has become increasingly frustrating ever since keystones.
Only rank system metters. (Skill)
"Honestly... right now, I despise the game. 9 years of having to deal with toxic abuse that has only escalated over the years has killed any joy this game brought me.  Its got to the point where 9/10 games are ruined to toxicity, so whats the point in playing?"
"Just the way honor system works and skins, it's just right if you want freebies. "
no pay to win
"Lore, aesthetics, character diversity, constant updates"
"The lore and worldbuilding, the character design and the art"
The game in general.
I guess... the rank?
At the moment only the Skins
The variety of champions and their mechanics like Kled and Ivern
Free keys
"Talon "
mastery system
gameplay and artn
Teamwork and strategy
"Currently, nothing. That's the reason I stopped playing."
PvE
I like certain champions and the satisfaction they give you. Other than that the game is terrible and keeps getting even worse.
gameplay is fun
Currently nothing. The only thing I liked was my Old Irelia before her rework.
"I Like the honor system even tho it isnt rewarding enought i like the infinite level cap, the champions that the game offers me, and the constant changes every patch to keep it fresh"
"Competitive game with a large audience "
the strategy aspect and the quick timing necessary to make good calls
Try-hard gameplay.
I don't know anymore
The game in general
"replayability, it's free"
"rewards for doing good (chests for performing well, key fragments for sportsmanship)"
I think it's an enjoyable game when I have friends in a call. I basically play exclusively with others now and only ever really play ranked at the end of the season for the skin. It's also quite humorous when a funny interaction happens between me and other random players online.
"The competitive nature, the skins are amazing, and before they became a monthly thing, the events that actually gave tons of content to play with (First Bilgewater event, Star Guardian PvE, etc)"
i guess Aatrox an Kayn are the very last things i actually enjoy in this game.
I like playing clash with friends
"skins, rotating game modes, pve"
The competitive aspect. I just love the game
"Its a mutual game between all my friends, and i just love playing Poppy :]"
"Honestly, I can think of more things I dislike about LoL than what I like. Winning is nice, though. "
competitiveness
"Now, nothing really. The game is unbalanced, Riot doesnt listen to us. I am here for 9 years already. "
"I used to like its balance, now I'm just addicted. "
"The game itself, its story, its art, "
"General gameplay "
Nothing anymore
I LIKED the Macro game and strategic diversity
"Memes, Hextech Crafting, Lore, Experimenting"
it used to be the strategy but that's gone now
LoL is just a mean to me to manage some of my daily stress. If Aram didnt exist I would have quited a long ago.
competitive game

"Skins do make things interesting, but overall I like the game in general."

"Esports, the art and music team."
Currently Nothing
"I like that it's free, but anymore there are too many champions and the rune/item system is too convoluted for new players to really get a grasp on"
"The idea of a MOBA with clear visuals "
Basic gameplay
champion diversity and perpetual change
Cooperative game with competitive elements. Nice skins and a few interesting characters.
"The gameplay "
Champion themes and abilities
"I no longer enjoy this game, the only reason i'm playing is because the time investment"
Master Yi only
"The world building, The game itself"
Competitive nature and some characters
"competitive system, skins, rank, show of skill"
"skins, playing with friends"
ALIENS. ABUCTION.  LONG-LEGGED-FEMALE ALIENS.
I like URF. Literally nothing else. This game needs end. Riot needs to be bombed.
" w i n n i n g, and the lore is pretty cool"
"nothing anymore,at this point im running on the sunken cost falacy"
"i enjoy the concept of the game, when it's working as intended, having a lot of competitive depth. i also really enjoy the sound design of a lot of things in league"
How every champ is unique and fun to play and all the skins are made very well.
Just gameplay
Nothing
"I like the dynamics of ARAM and alternative fun game modes that RIOT releases from time to time (like Ascension, Dominion). Rest is probably a sentiment that makes me come back to this game."
A free-to-play game with good real money store options is always nice to see.
Being able to play with friends; that's about it.
It's a MOBA

"Rpg elements, well designed, fun"
"mechanics of the game, teamfights, honor(not the actual system) skins and free loot, RGM(rip)"
The unique characters it offers
"I kinda don't anymore, not gonna lie. I used to like their art team & lore team before *those* started getting to be as poor as balance team"
"Exotic picks, free contents from loot, temporary gamemodes (ARURF, One For All mostly)"
"Characters, Skins and The Lore"
"Mainly the fact that CAN be a fun game, but most of the time it isn't"
Getting a good Score
just palying against others and winning
teamwork
Honor system / Skins / Community

"characters, humor, art"
At this point due to what LoL has become I stopped liking most things about it.
Good depth of gameplay and game knowledge.  Skins are nice.

"Cosmetics, Large Champion Pool, Events, Masteries "
fuck this game
"Skins and certain champs, though honestly part of the reason I'm still playing despite the game being so unbalanced is because of how much money I've spent on this game"
"I like the lore they've been putting out with short stories and comics, some of the skins can be nice and reworks/new champs keep some interest of mine for a little while, but outside of that not much else."
"Rewarding strategic plays, and plenty of variety in off-meta picks/runes/builds"
Its fun and communicating with the team is fun even though they can be toxic.
Gameplay
Playing with friends
The game itself is amazing and offers many diverse champions for many different play-styles. The art/music department are incredibly talented.
"Competitive close games, cool skins, music."
"Honor system is just a shitty system that Riot can use to punish you. The ban system is complete shit. Just because you say one word in a game, the system will flag you even if you're playing with an entire group of friends and then ban your ass."
"lore, art, skns, couple of friends that havent left I can play with"
"that theres a rank ladder, nothing else."

Esports scene. The skins
"Skins, Champion diversity"
competion
"I like the fact that toxic people tend to get punished more frequently than in earlier seasons, even though the honor system is not flawless, it does work in some regards and I like the fact that honor matters when it comes to cosmetics and such."
"Skins are looking nice, game concept is fun"
The game itself
Some skins even tho overpriced as hell. Music. Everything else is pretty bad atm.
i like warwick

"Skill-depth one can reach; entire flow of the match, from PvE focused lane farming/jungling entwined with occasional PvP trades onto full-blown teamfights during mid/late game"
most of it
