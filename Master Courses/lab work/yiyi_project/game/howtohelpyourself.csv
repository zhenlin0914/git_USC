Mute them when they start to become too annoying
"Mute them.  If others respond negatively to the toxicity of said muted individual, occasionally I will also suggest that they mute them as well, and forget about what was said."
"all in all its w/e, toxicity is funny most of the time in my opinion and if everyone is extremely positive even when losing it can give the players who are terrible a false sense of pride. If you make a mistake even if its small you need to be called out. It's also the internet so people need to grow up, when someone calls you an idiot you dont need to flip shit."
Mute
"Start troll building. AP Jayce, Bruiser Jayce, etc."

Tell them they're in the wrong or try to calm them down
Mute the toxic player
"I used to be toxic back, but after getting medication for ADHD, I learned to just be chill, ignore, even mute if it is bad enough and continue playing the game. Sometimes saying encouraging words do help diffuse the toxicity because most of the time, the toxic people WANT to be good, WANT to be validated. So if you throw them a bone, they tend to get back on track in the mindset to win."

I prefer to counterflame because i know how to get them to continually go down the rabbit hole and give me a more valid report towards the banhammer.
I usually have to play therapist in most ranked games so we have a chance at winning but it's still lobsided against me
Try to calm them down had today a mundo player who was toxic and wanted to forfeit the game told him to calm down and said we have lategame. Eventually we made a comeback 25 min into the game and ran them down. I think the mundo player will not give up so easily in future games
