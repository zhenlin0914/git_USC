What do you think are the most common situations in game that spur the players to become toxic?
"Someone being ""bad"" or playing anything that isn't meta.  Sometimes too people just take normal games waaay to seriously"

feeding
Doing poorly
"High MMR ARAM (yes its a thing) has 2 types of people; Tryhards and people who play for fun. The problem arises when both of these types of players enter the same team because they both have different means of getting to different goals; tryhards want to win using meta champs and builds while for fun players play whatever they feel is fun for fun. Usual what happens in this circumstance is that the tryhard player will tilt as soon as seeing an unconventional build and proceed to harass that individual leading to a loss, even if the tryhard did poor and the other player did well."

People doing poorly or intentionally feeding.
"I believe a major spur of toxic behavior is the  internet anonymity in itself that allows toxic players to treat others unkindly with minimum repercussions to their real life. I also feel that it boils down to people's personal ethics. If they do not value other players as a real person behind a computer, then that increases the likelihood of toxic behavior to occur.  These two points is what fuels the fire to toxic behavior when things go negatively for them in game (Them dying, or teammates dying, anything that causes them to ""lose"")"
bad performances
Dying in game
They feel like they are losing due to something outside of their control.

"3-4 big mistakes from a teammate "
"When losing or discussing a disagreement in a play "
Mental issues or just riots match-making/their faulty system
A bad game.
Dying early in the game
The game is simply too complicated for players to understand and the constantly evolving system of league has made it basically so much in favor of smurfs. I have seen new players literally being killed in fountain or being held hostage by smurfs and they cant really do anything about it. Not very good for the economy of the game ya know and well those situations force the players to become toxic simply because the game has evolved too much its too boring to play and too complicated for new players and overall moba games are designed in a way that makes the player feel content when winning and miserable when losing so you see when the players lose they feel miserable which leads them to being toxic and grieving or trolling the team.Simply the design of a moba game.

"The most common situations that spur players to become toxic are probably when teammates die too quickly/too much, and when players do not listen to another's pings."

Teammate Feeds
"Doing poorly in game, coming off of a bad game, another teammate doing poorly in game, and just being a jerk."
Feeding.
"they are bad at the game, and they want to blame it on others"
"Banning hovered picks and/or Pointing out mistakes in a teasing way, generally offensive."
The most I have seen is when someone does a bad play that ends the lane. Such as say an enemy ADC is 1/0 but the Jungle dives the enemy ending with the enemy ADC getting triple kill + double buffs effectively ending the lane for you.
Thinking they're god
Intentional feeding and AFK
Frustration at self performance in the current game or a series of losses.

Enemy teams snowballing
"Everything "
Lack of communication with teammates. Especially a lack of voice communications

"inting , afk , trolls , that type of stuff"
"When someone dies, feeds or calls out other player."
"Its pretty split between them just being toxic from the start of the game and being toxic because someone else (or team) isn't doing well. I've even had people be toxic starting in the champion selection, though that is defintley more uncommon than it starting in-game."
Not doing what they asked.

Players don't want to lose and will flame over any mistake others make.
"bot lane feeding | x lane feeding | x is feeding and cries out to the jungler (no ganks) | getting camped by the jungler while you're a losing lane not worth bothering with | "
unprovoked
when there's something at stake: lp. Or when the player gets frustrated by dying a lot or having someone else die a lot due to the damage creep.
They start losing
"Players dying, or their own poor playing"
They die once in lane and spam surrender.
"When an individual player isn't performing well, s/he often becomes the target of flame or flames others for not helping him/her. "
"Balance and team fights. "
Losing their lane
Being Dogshit
"If they are winning. If they are winning they always try to be toxic towards the enemy team like saying ""ez"" just to bother the enemy."
dying or others flaming
pinging them
"the person who carries the game has most of the pressure, but i think its possible that everyone can be toxic"

Losing lane to unbalanced champs
They're tilted
"People hate to lose, their own mistakes "
If another teammate plays below average. Or if the person in question plays below average themselves.
When they die early game or get camped
"Game encourages players to be toxic, unlike any real sport, it doesn't matter if you are a god or very bad, all losers lose same LP, while in real sport, imagine cristiano ronaldo in football (soccer), he started in manchester city, because he was so good he gradually improved finally ending in real madrid. in classroom, work place or sports everyone only cares about his performance, because at the end of day everyone is judged based on his performance. while in league of legends such a system doesn't exist, therefore when someone is playing good but has a feeder and loses he becomes toxic, it can be fixed easily by an anti feeder system (ex: lock player ranked mode if they were 0/5 or 1/6 or ... in a ranked game) or a real life sport system. the current league system is named after a scientist (Elo) and he invented this system for chess that is a solo game, they should use different stats and reduce the most LP from the worst player and reduce a negligible amount from the best player. same can be applied for winners or not. "
"When someone isn't doing well, KDA wise"
Mad about getting their shit kicked in.
they dont care
Retardation

"inability to play the game past 20 minutes because the game is over.  That knowledge by itself makes everyone rage at someone that does poorly, that makes people give up, and it also just makes everyone not want to play the rest of that game out because its easier to just move on to another game and hope that someone on your team gets fed.  15-20 minute games vs 1 long 35-40 minute game that results in a loss.  "

Things like getting camped or 100-0'd with little to no counterplay
Shitmates with a different gameplan than they do... or no map awareness.
Assassin players flaming their team for basic mistakes.
"ignorance, collateral damage, surrender"
trolls or players that are delusional and blame others for their own mistakes

Poor performance
"People making the same mistake repeatedly and getting frustrated with them "
"There are multiple reasons why people become toxic in league. Most of them are based on the projection of real life issues onto the game. Competitive games have different problems. Missing control over the game increases the chance that people do whatever they can to get control cause they feel helpless in rl. Being mean to others often results out of frustation and aggression they got build up and use the anonymity of the internet for it. One of the biggest issues tho is that you need to fight yourself to stay nice in this game. Surround yourself with people you want to be like right? league is filled with toxicity. i saw the nicest people getting literally corrupted by the amount of hate this game radiates "
