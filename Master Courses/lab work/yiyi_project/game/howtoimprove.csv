What are your thoughts on improving the overall gaming environment?
1 acc 1 ID. kids now days have no respect towards older people
Penalty or reward
" I think Riot should take more responsibility for toxic behavior, and people who generally make the game worse"
"Event skins, for example Ice King Twitch, should have a few chromas that can be bought without the need of the event. Saying ""kys"" in chat shouldn't be punished with a 2 week ban, it's unfair against the person who wrote it, cause it isn't even a fully written term. . And if someone actually, which is not funny, commits suicide, saying ""kys"" should never be blamed for that. Would you put your head in the oven if I told you to?"
Immediate punishment in games
"Honestly i have none, society always has assholes, seeing them in game doesn't make it any different, except that you have more options to mute, or leave the game all together."
improving the report system to be more percise other than detecting curses and having reports for many other kinds of misbehaviors.
"I think that people need to be more understanding of the situations of others that may inhibit their play performance. "
"Bring back dominion, remove forced 50% "
"Harsher punishments for people with negative behavior "
"There needs to be some form of bad luck protection that prevents people from being demoted. But the BIGGEST thing that would change the game for the better and make it less toxic would be to remove the promotion match feature completely. It causes players to be extremely toxic after failing them countless times. "
Actually balance the game and stop the terrible matchmaking
I don't really have one
more legendaries
"I think players should be allowed to say whatever they want, so long as it isn't a personal threat. Mute button is there for a reason. I also think that Riot should focus more on banning people that directly influence the game (INTers) and not punish so hard for saying offensive words because like I said, they can be muted."
People need to both chill out and get thicker skin
Ppl stop circlekerling and saying the game is toxic and bad
banning people more frequently
It would make the game a lot more fun to play and probably bring in new players.
"I feel like not too much can be done besides reporting players. The game is infamous for its toxicity, and I think the only way to make the environment better it to just be nice to other players. Even just saying some kind words of encouragement to your team can make someone's day a little better. There are real people behind every monitor, and there's no reason to make someone's day worse by being toxic to them when everyone is supposed to be working together. I find my most enjoyable games aren't the ones where I completely stomp the other team, but when my team works together, win or lose."
It's Riot's duty to make the game less toxic.
"Having matchmaking transparent. Having real currency for skin etc. Purchases, focussing on community and healthy systems as opposed to hook style gambling phycology to make players feel enticed to spend."
A better report/banning system and less smurfs.
"Make the game less frusterating by actually fixing the problems, rather than Riot constantly creating band-aid fixes which only end up making the game state worse"
"A stricter and more effective punishment system, which I feel allows a lot of toxic players to slide through the cracks. I think the idea that Blizzard implemented in Overwatch for things like GG EZ might be a good thing to implement in league as well. Finally, changes in the game state to allow a little more power back to the individual like previous seasons and the reduction of damage might really improve overall game state. These days in high elo it feels like games are lost far more often than they are won."
"Have the honor system mean more, as in better prizes, and have reporting toxic players do more"
Streamers are a big influence on players so they should be a good influence to improve the environment
Learn to balance one audience instead of 4
"Honestly, I'm not sure we can at this point. Toxicity is in every game where there are people in teams facing against each other. It'd be great, and there are definitely some games where it seems to exist less than in League (Overwatch, for example) and perhaps we could study what makes those different."
"Banned players can return with new accounts. As long as that option exists, toxicity will never decrease"
"Add voice chat. People cannot hide behind the voice, but they can hide behind they chat."
good
Better punishment system
Stop banning toxics and start banning trolls and inters more
"remove chat completely and adding a free for all mode "
improving the report/punishment system
"I think the best way to improve the attitude of players is to try and shake off league's stigma of having a bad player base.  The majority of players aren't toxic, but many flamers seem to hold to the idea that the league community is mostly toxic."
"Improve matchmaking, actually punish trolling/AFKs, improve balance"
"The best way to improve a game is to make it as balanced as possible, so everyone has a winning chance."
Maybe an improved honour system? Otherwise no idea. If it was something easy to resolve we would have a much healthier environment by now.
I think banter is fine but feeding is not. I belive people need to grow thicker skin and just retort which may lead to more toxic behavior but  as long as everyone is still trying their best i believe it would be fine. I also dislike the punitive system in general and the idea of restricting what opinions you can say in an online game for fun. Chat should be more free range while actions should be judged more harshly as someone reporting someone for toxic chat just to get them banned is unacceptable and things like these kinds of bans are most common in na in korea you can't really get banned for flaming./
People need to be more chill. They start being toxic for the smallest of things.
"balance unbalanced heroes please riot games "
"something like low prio. queue but for toxic players, match them with each other and it's leave ranked queues clean"
"I really don't know what can be done to limit toxicity. I feel like toxicity comes with the competitive and anonymous aspect of this kind of games. While I think that harsher punishments would somewhat reduce toxicity especially for those who have spent a lot in the game and would not want to lose their accounts, but I know of people that have been banned without reason and i have seen toxic teams mass reporting people, so I also fear harsher more ""trigger happy"" punishments would end up exacerbating the problem. I also think even more taunty additions to the game like Eternals will just make the problem worse. "
Get rid of the hitech client and go back to simple yet functional.
"Fire the entire live balance team, and the current lead game designers; they have no idea what the actual fuck they are doing, and turning League into a faster and faster paced game, removing the core structure of what it used to be, demolishing defence, vision, and the durability and safety provided by structures while simultaenously continuning to overload and overtune newer releases, and power, mobility, and damage creeping the fuck out of the game has vastly increased the toxicity present by removing the agency of players, the counterplay availible to them, and the ability to react and counter-act/build/play their opponents.  As a result, a once comical and fun, albeit competetive game has become an utter hellhole of toxicity, pissed off and frustrated players, and is overall a demonstrably worse experience for all involved.  Undoing even the smallest portion of these changes would be transformative for League as a whole, but especially so for toxicity and player experience."
extend the game length - let us buy more than 6 items (7 - elixir)
"Don't perma ban people for flaming, put more money into actually looking at people inting and limit testing should be bannable."
i think people need to accept that they're shit and its not always another ones fault
increase the punishment system for toxic players; have some more immediate punishment that could be more punishing; increase the honor system and appeal players to be more friendly
Fix the client
If Riot wants to improve the overall gaming environment then they need to fix the game first and their banning system. The fact that the players who flame are mostly flaming for good reason (Our bot lane is 2/15 only 17 minutes into the game. Yet the toxic player telling them to just play safe or afk is the one who gets banned)
"None, particularly. Just ignoring and being a positive player is the best I can do."
"If you can't handle toxic people, mute them. If you are a toxic person, mute everyone. If you care about your sanity mute everyone."
pretty toxic.
Ban trolls and bad players from ranked.
Make queues for toxic players only as punishment
"I hope it happens but I don't know if LoL is salvageable "
"I don't think it can happen, people are naturally toxic in this type of a game"
"Better honor systems "
"i think something should be done about the toxic behavior but at the same time i think its really difficult to deal with the volume of toxicity that is in league of legends, and i dont fault riot for the toxicity, but rather the nature of the game"
BALANCE TEAM
make the punishments for toxic behavior much more severe on the first offense
"This isnt really a possibility unless they push for a more ""single player carry"" orrented. This is an inate issue in any team game where it easy to blame a teammate. "
Fix ranked matchmaking so that teams are more evenly matched instead of one sided stomps
"Needs to be more incentives for behaving well, and swifter punishment for occasional offenders"
"Adding an in-game voice chat might be good, it's harder to flame people when you need to say the words instead of typing them"
Don't ban people for saying mean words
"Revert league to season 6, fix mmr, throw diamonds back into gold, fix high elo"
Just nerf the damage and snowball
people with anger issues gotta stop playing league lmfao
Having better balance and a good report system
"I think it would improve the quality of all games. "
"Harder punishment for griefing and picking yasuo or riven on my team team "
none
BAN INTERS AND LET MA FLAME IN PEACE
"Definitely we should be able to honor enemies again maybe for more different reasons than just honorable opponents but that’s pretty much it "
Honestly I think if the game were more balanced then it would be less toxic
there needs to be a larger effort from both the community and developers to promote good behavior and discourage toxic
"More chat bans. A lot more. Chat is where the vast majority of toxicity start. There'd be less of it if people couldn't talk. "
Heavier penalties for toxic behaviour.
"I'd like to see it done. I don't think it can be with the team that Riot has, and the mindset that Riot has."
"just have RIOT Games properly balance the game, that's all that's necessary."
"Nerf: Mage Items, Riven, Revert or gut Akali, nerf renekton, NERF NERF NERF. Just nerf everything. Revert rengar Q please, he has no counterplay, coming from a half rengar main. IGN: Godlybane"
"Environment? A lot of it stems from discomfort with the game itself. The broken ranked system, the forced 50%, the balance ever since S6 to a few weeks ago, etc. have made things feel so restrictive that it feels punishing to play the game as anything but what is pre-defined, so tensions run higher, easier."
Dont care much
Bring in people who know how to balance a MOBA and have real matchmaking. OR just go back to the good days where each role had its own role instead of all champs 100-0 others.
"Riot honestly needs to step up their ability to ban people for the things I've seen on a pretty regular basis. Racism, sexism, and out right ruining at least 4 other people's time playing (if not also ruining the other teams' time)."
Maybe riot can do better balancing so they don't snowball way too hard
"Handling toxicity as an issue that affects everyone and is not limited to certain groups would probably get more people on board imo. From my experience, framing every problem as a gender, race, sex issue usually divides people more than anything."
give league to another company
players need to learn to not lash out or respond to trolls
I honestly just wish that people would realize that this was a team-oriented game instead of always thinking for themselves.
"Removing autofill would lead to fewer trolls/toxic players. Lessening snowballing assassins and ""tanks"" that end up with more damage than said assassins would likely also help to reduce toxicity (it doesn't feel good to get steamrolled into the ground). Honestly just a better balanced game would help more than anything."
i don' t know
To many people crying because they got called a poopy head
"I think some people need to realize that getting angry or upset is normal, and others need to realize that video games are usually created for people who want to have fun. That's until you hit the high ranks or pro tiers where you're playing for money."
Mandatory phone # verification for all accounts to decrease smurfs. It's too easy to start a new account after a player is banned.
"most of the time, people should realise they have other people in front of them"
Trying not to be tilted
Riot probably won't do it because they don't really care.
"Figure out a way to ban people more quickly for trolling. They have the toxic speech covered, but the way they deal with trolling is severely lacking"
a complete overhaul to how the game works is needed imho
murder all game balancers at riot and replace them with new ones
"League has a lot of issues right now. Everyone has been saying for 2 seasons now that the balance team should be replaced and other measures should be taken. More and more players quit because it just does not feel fun anymore. Being autofilled as a jungler feels extremly bad because if you make one mistake you're going to be behind for the rest of the game, support items are boring, all adcs but ezreal and kaisa get instakilled in soloq by the popular assassins, toplane feels like a farm simulator fiesta for 90% of the game and you're also not even able to help your other teammates as much, and midlane is the most stressful role because you just have so much stuff to pay attention to(jungler invades, enemy roams, etc.) "
Removing player agency is never the answer
dunno how thats even possible. but it would be great to achieve.
Balance the game better and focus on reports better.
6 month chat bans.
"I think it would be good to have a human overseeing decisions regarding bans as opposed to the system being automatic. I think a lot of times, people who actually troll and ruin games go unpunished. "
"I wish people who were kind got more rewards, rather then just the player who does the best."
"Overall I think league isn't as toxic as everyone says, we only remember bad experiences and forgot neutral or positive experiences quickly"
riot doesnt care about doing so. people need to grow up.
"Honestly, I haven't experienced as much toxic behavior in other games.  Not exactly sure why, could just be that I play other games a lot less.  Still, I have never experienced anything as bad as LoL in things like Overwatch, CoD, PUBG, etc."
Creating a more fair game play environment by making certain characters feel more fair to play against and more rewarding to play
"I'm not sure it's possible. In order to improve it, one would have to improve the already toxic game state. Many toxic people are merely products of their environment, and league itself is a very frustrating game. Competitiveness often breeds such things, I'm afraid"
"It's almost as hopeless task as to stop cheaters in csgo "
winning
"Remove the loot box system. (Like ""Little Legends"")"
"What environment. Everything is managed by a bot unless a streamer makes a complaint that its sometimes done by human involvement. "
Less toxicity -&gt; More players enjoying this game
"IDK my bff Jill? "
"it is doomed, Spanish and turkish communities are the reason why we cant do anything to improve the environment. Being toxic is in their DNA"
"Less change,more listening to the community cause you know those guys who are challenger and crying are challenger for a reason,better punishment system,better afk system,less complicated client and less buggy of course and we can also use some skins on the forgotten champs."
An entirely different approach to the development of the game.
I think the chat needs to be a bit more strict.
More punishment being handed out
Vhat restrictions should be way more common. Reporting players seems to have almost no real impact. I meet truly bannable toxic players maybe once a week. And I rarely get feedback on my reports.
Competitive = impatient
Actually enforcing more punishment on flame than a chat restriction. If in order to play better in a team based game is to /muteall then what's even the point? Also add public voice chat.
A fairer matchmaking system and higher punishment for toxic behavior
"Stricter punishments for serious offences like trolling, griefing, intentionally feeding and AFKing "
The gaming community in general is good. Leagues is a cesspool of just hatred.
im not really sure
Balancing that reduced the ability to be one-shot and start feeling bad about dying quickly
Actually taking in and handling reports. I stay away from ranked because of the toxicity I see happen to friends. New players definitely do not feel welcomed.
Punishing players who abuse the guidelines and not pick and choose who gets punished and who doesn’t. Automatic punishment for use of certain words. Being consistent!!
"Too many younger players basing their behavior off of how streamers behave- streamers need to tighten it up and act more mature, be better examples for their audience."
"I think Riot should be more transparent with player's chat logs when they get punished because I believe that their toxic words are not always shown back to them, so maybe if players see what they are saying outside of the game environment, then they can better reflect on their behavior."
"Ways to reduce toxicity and deal with trolls, like report function during champion select."
Mandatory video conference with teammates before and after game
"banning people does nothing, and just makes the bad actors worse"
More collecting of and listening to player feedback by Riot
Make the banning system not a joke.
"better matchmaking would go a long way, but riot, yea"
"if riot fixed its community. it is extremely toxic. people love to blame others and then flame them. riot wont ban those people but bans people for saying ""f u"" in response. Ban the aggressors"
"People can try and stop the impulse to immediately go full on toxic mode when something bad happens or to accept that they made a mistake when they did or accept the fact that someone made a mistake and that's fine (as long as they don't repeat it on purpose and/or for too many times). That'd help a bit, in my opinion."
Improving ban system (spam ping lead to a permaban). Better matchmaking for ranked and placements.
Make the game balanced and fair.
Online clubs might help.  Similar to a beer league in other sports.
Make the game less risky and enable comebacks. Lower the learning curve with less damage.
"Add voice chat to all teammates, so the communication and the calls are clearer."
not sure what this means
"Implementing voice chat. People generally tend to be a bit less toxic with VC. Or don't talk, words will be understood easier as genuine criticism or help. Accounts being banned from ranked play more harshly, to try to keep it's integrity. Reducing the power of frustrating champions. Including more ""for fun"" features like RGM that reduce the competitiveness for those that do not want it. "
"All in all, it is what it is. There are positive experiences and negative experiences and letting the negatives get to you seems pointless to me. I've been told to kill myself for counterjungling as Shaco and I thought it was great because the enemy jungler was tilted beyond belief and that means I did my job well."
Fix the toxicity or people will continue to make it worse untill it is fixed.
"great idea, but we are soooo far into the toxic clouds its will be hard to get out with this community"
"I think riot is doing a great job with quite a bit.  I'd like to see new gamemodes, even if they are temporary like Star Guardian stuff in the past.  It gives players a break from the usual high stress ranked games.  Focusing on balance and working around both high level players AND low level, not just buffing certain champions because it is right before Worlds."
"In general, Riot listening to the community. I've seen them make decisions that we, the players, strongly disagreed with. Such as balancing decisions, pricing, game development and features, amongst other things. I believe it's the main thing to start working with in order to make a better gaming environment, because this way, players would feel more inclined to play, not because they are addicted to it, but because they really want to, making it a more enjoyable experience. After that, I believe some form of reward for good behavior and sportsmanlike conduct would be a good incentive, but I don't think the honor system is a good way to do it, since there's no real reward for it other than two skins/chromas and a ward."
improvements on the ban system(stricter bans)
Nerf everything
ban actual trolls.
"Nerf champions, stop buffing them."
It is very hard. People use anonymity to their advantage in online communities when it comes to exaggerating their emotions.
copying Dota2's punishment system
"Much Needed, but people need thick skin in the world of gaming"
"better balance team, new gamemodes RELATED to core LOL"
"Just remove chat and add emotes like in hearthstone. Or, just remove chat and communicate with pings."
"More 'for fun' gamemodes, continue to rotate gamemodes like they planned."
Make it so people below plat can't post on reddit or lolboards
"Don't respond to toxicity or just ignore it, don't let it bother you."
"If I could then that would be great, but riot is doing the opposite (or nothing) about the toxicity so there is not much for me to do as I am unable to spread positivity (despite it having signs of potential to those who can)."
"Bring back the tribunal report system. "
Can't really say.
"Bring back old game modes, fix your matchmaking system and punish all afkers and toxicity. Stop allowing the toxicity to spread and decay LP for players who are innocent and try their best to rank up."
Listen to our feedback
Riot listening to the player bases demands
"Bring back the tribunal system "
Make the game more fun to play and people will be less toxic
"If you moderate chat, at least do it well. Improve matchmaking (bad teammates are the main cause of tilt/toxicity from my experience). Actually ban people who troll/grief"
"Somehow convince people to realize that the other players are people to, with their own lives and thoughts and ideas and thus snot shit on them."
"Get rid of trolls, ints and afks "
"Remove champs like yuumi, zoe, master yi, qiyana, sylas, and other cancer champs. But buff teemo cause i main"
"Less damage, more tactical stuff. Also, less damage, and less mobility. Less damage would also help."
improve the ARAM randomness to balance the teams a bit. And to have humans look at the reports more often.
Best players in the game should help
"Toxicity needs to be squashed out. It's almost every day that I go into a game and at least one match with have a toxic person. I would love to see this improved, but seeing as it keeps happening, I feel like it never will."
"i hope riot improves the ban system, since there are lots of players who break the rules constantly and remain intact"
both community and developers need to work togheter
If people just didn't let words on the internet affect them as much. The problem is bad events always stick closer in your memory then good events.
"start banning feeders and afkers and trolls "
"Punish hate speech and verbal abuse/harassment more aptly; incentivize players to be ""honorable"" and help each other out"
I would like there to be a minimal amount of toxicity amongst all games.
I’d love to see people becoming more self aware of what they say and how it can affect others. Tbh I have a really low tolerance to people getting bullied etc.
It's a noble cause
I don't know
hire new teams across the board
Fix balancing and matchmaking
"less damage and mobility creep, less snowballing so mistakes don't cost game = no flaming"
"I think that people need to just stay calmer while playing. I feel that tilting in a game is the worst thing someone can do besides trolling to hurt your chances of winning. "
I wish riot made more of an effort to improve the game and not just monetizing the game harder
Not possible since Riot doesnt care about the game anymore
"Proper Balance, less dmg and mobility, talent trees to make champions feel distinct in each game or to each player's style."
"I think if player reports were taken more into consideration for the comments they present, as well as the in-game context, the game would be a less toxic place."
"Idk I just want to have fun playing league without being flamed in every single game.  "
it would be great riot doesn t seem to give 2 shits they just want to dry our wallets
"possibly getting better A.I. to detect bad behaviour if possible, expand honour system to encourage healthy behaviour instead of just neutral behaviour."
"Not sure if entirely possible, most systems made do discourage toxicity backfire and cause even more toxicity"
"It's hard to do, with such a frustrating game as this one, but the ban systems would need to be improved for toxic players. "
Honestly its a mindset. I troll and enrage people when i feel like it. If i want peace and quiet or faulty games I just mute all. Then there is no toxicity whatsoever.
"The balance team needs to stop lying to us, they aren't attempting to balance the game and league isn't what it used to be. I play TFT exclusively and SR with friends."
Riot's most recent money-related endeavors have been... cheap and cash-grabby. I think that being more fair and less greedy would help the community get better.
There isn't enough focus on it.
"riot needs to make it so that games are detirmined by the strongest player, not the weakest one. If this happened, less people will be toxic since the bad player won't negativley affect another's gameplay as long as they themselves are good at the game."
"My thoughts? Well, they don't do anything, so what thoughts are there to be?"
"Force the game to stop being a coin flip type of game. I agree the game should not be won by a single player, but at the same time the game should not be lost because of a single player."
"Good luck with that, people are jerks by nature"
Make chests always drop skins instead of champ shards
"Cut off the head of toxicity, in this case all the thousand+ viewership streamers that get away with it should be severely punished."
"Remove Eternals. Fix the damn client. Listen to the community complaints for once. "
Afk/Trolls should be punished harder than chat
"Less reportable offenses, less player restrictions"
"Focus less of reducing verbal toxicity and put efforts into banning gameplay toxicity (trolling/griefing, wintrading, etc)"
"Come down harder  on people who flame others.  90% of the time I get toxic it's in response to being flamed or someone flaming a teammate.  If there was a smaller punishment for flamers it might stop the spiral from escalating. "
"Chat restrictions help, BUT the law of unintended consequences comes into play here: instead of being *verbally* toxic (which some individuals still are and interestingly don't realize/think they are), they have found other ways to be toxic (ex. run it down mid, park in the nexus, role-steal).  At the moment, RIOT gives too much benefit-of-the-doubt to those types of behaviors.  If it's one game, the players can get a pass, but if it's a pattern of behavior then action needs to be taken.  (((side note cuz I don't know if this will come up later: I spoke earlier about the lack of empathy.  Road rage is very similar to in-game toxicity: you aren't interacting with people directly just 'avatars', so the rage comes out when behaviors you don't like (ex. driving too slowly, cutting people off) are experience.  Maybe there's a correlation there.)))"
Encourage other players to take time off league.
Make individual performances matter in correlation to ranked progression
"More strict bans / non-automated report system. "
Riot.... Listen to your players. Not money
improve the honor system
thats a milion dollar question my dude
"Better Balance, Less snowball-effects. Higher trade-Off for mobility. Less overloaded Kits. Punish afker a Lot Harder."
"Just revert all the clutter things in the client. "
Shooting the balance team and replacing it
Absolutely must happen. Games that have good communities that are not toxic always keep me happy for longer and way more willing to get involved in out-of-game activities/events
Matchmaking is not even. One sided stomps.
"Making it feel fair for everybody "
better nuance with the punishment system. as hard as it is to pay for it try to make a wing of people to watch replays 'if submitted' to see intentionally toxic behaviors.
Dunno
"Find a way to punish toxicity, afk, troll and griefers more severely. "
it would be nice cause then there'd be less jerks
Punish Trolling
"Unlikely to happen and from my experience it is mostly fine with most players not saying much outside of game stuff ""like mid MIA"" ""X champion Flash"""
"new and improved report system , with more than just a 3-lignes-of-codes-bot =)"
It needs  to be improved or it might be the game demise
"I think its an incredibly ambitious and difficult thing to do. Especially when sometimes there is such a blurry line between regular players and toxic players. For example, i had a game where i tried annie for the first time and fed the enemy to oblivion. I kept dying every few minutes or so. I really didn't mean to, i just didn't click with the champ and the enemy was much more experienced. I was extremely flamed that game and probably reported. So in this situation, is it right to punish me? To outsiders, i looked like someone who was running down mid constantly. But to those who know my story are aware I just had a really bad game. Ive had times where i had a few bad games in a row and wondering if I was going to get punished if enough people reported me. So while i absolute support Riot trying to improve the gaming environment, i also hope they dont go to far and make the system so sensitive it punish regular players such as myself or may play bad once in a while or afk due to an emergency/internet connection problems. "
"Remove the report system, all anyone ever does is cry out for reports in all chat."
"Make ranked better (d2 and only earning 13-14 while losing 16 which is not just me but others) liston to the community (like all chat, that was an amazing show) change report system so It is an actual not joke"
"Create more casual based gamemodes as well as improving the honor system to actually grant incentive to be a sportsmanlike player. Such as skins, loading borders, things that you can wear in your game. Icons aren't gonna cut it."
would happy to see that happening
"That would be great. "
"Link smurf accounts to a players main account "
"Riot spends the bulk of their time in player reform focusing on chat rather than performance. If someone is tilted and afk splits and spends all game feeding forcing a 4v5, Riot does NOTHING. The other issue is Riot does not provide nearly enough feedback as to what actions are taken against players. I want to know that toxic players are punished, but their current notification is both too infrequent and contains zero specifics as to what/who was punished."
"This game is fucked "
If everyone uninstalls
Balance around soloq
"They need to stop the severe punishment on chat. Punishment should only be applied to intentionally feeding and afks(Im honor 5, and have never been banned)"
"More creative skins/concepts, less cashgrabs. And i hope they release more interactive supports."
no idea
I want it to get better yes.
More ramifications for toxicity and more active moderators to look over such toxicity should improve the environment as people would not be willing to flame if they knew what was at stake
"I wish there was a way. But short of acquiring the money to buy Riot back from Tencent, I don't really see it as a possibility."
I think that toxicity should be handled in a different manner than the way it is now.
"get rid of the current balance team,fire the group leads (they boost based on who's getting the skin), and revamp their entire report/punishment system because it's clearly not working"
This game needs a better punishment system. Something that can detect trolls better. The amount of trolls in league is way too high
less frustrating gameplay; less harsh snowballing/no damage creep
"Stop trying to steal my damn money through pointless things, I already buy skins, that should be enough"
I wish there was a way to promote nontoxic behavior better
Riot need to start caring about it's players at some point.
"A better detection system/heavier punishments for griefers, removing certain champions from the game (Pyke, Sylas, Zoe, Akali, Yuumi)"
"Wheeew that needs a 300 word essay buddy. The thing is frustration. Lot of people are frustrated and need an outlet. The game doesn't have any more outlets with removing other modes or refreshing events. Gameplay balance is fucked beyond repair and that makes players build more frustration. Ofc other factors but if the core of the problem is addressed. It could improve the game experience. "
would make the game less unbearable so that would be nice
"Harsher bans for toxic players, i swear half the time nothing happens"
"STOP GIVING CHAT BANS FOR TALKING, THERE IS A MUTE BUTTON PEOPLE SHOULD USE WHEN THEY GET OFFENDED THEY SHOULD USE IT AND LET THE TOXIC PLAYER FLAME TO HELP HIM REDUCE HIS FRUSTRATION. PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT TOXIC CHAT AND NOT USING THE MUTE BUTTON SHOULD BE GIVEN CHAT BANS"
Remove the balance team from exsistience and replace them.
Riot should focus more on their players instead of entirely focusing on pro play
stop banning people for flaming and pay more attention to afks and inting
more skins
i dont really thought about it
yes
Don’t be a dick to other people.
"older champions need to be updated to keep up with the qiyanas/akalis etc "
"Stop having an IQ below 100. No the guy who said ""retard"" is not the incarnation of hitler you dipwhit."
I described my thoughts in answer to : why you think players are toxic?
Impossible tbh.
"People need to be less negative, have more game knowledge, and keep their heads on straight."
be more harsh with toxicity
Buff toplane and delete tanks
"People need to stop giving words so much attention. A random player's opinions of your gameplay do not matter, you will likely never see them again. People as a whole need to grow much thicker metaphorical skin."
"Fun game but people afk a lot "
"I think its not possible because of riot it self they choose to punish those who mostly say 1-2 bad things but people who intentional feed and try and lose but make it look like they are trying (lots of videos on this) will get away for weeks or months at a time "
comms to reduce toxicity and improve game play quality
"Better reporting system, more focus on making the game enjoyable"
As much as I’d love to improve it Riot doesn’t seem to care this season so rip.
It's marked for death at this point. Unless Riot actually starts to care again.
Stop breeding riot
"To me toxicity in league and other games are the cause of the frustration players have, in the case of LoL the frustration comes from losing lane or feeling like there's nothing you can do in certain games"
Remove vladimir and the game is improved.
"Maybe have some actual humans reading over context in reports and not relying on some archaic chat detection. "
impossible
It'll be hard but can probably be done
"Its way too late to save, Riot fucked up big time seasons 6-9 because someone in the higher ups is full of their self.  "
probably wont happen when people cant listen to reason
better balance
"Reduce damage, make int feeding a perma ban, give constant toxicity a perma chat ban"
Punishing people who grief others
"Right now League can feel very bad to play due to toxic players. Riot adding the ability to disable ally chat is a great start, but the issue of trolling/AFKing is still at large, though I understand that it's a harder one to solve."
Idk
"Start by punishing those who ruin the game experience for everyone else, the general toxicity will decline"
"The game would become much better if players became less toxic and Riot improved their system. However, I don't see this happening, the community will sadly remain toxic."
horrible but addicted
"bring honorable oppenent back, bring tribunal back, get a report option even if the game was dodged"
"remove RNG, get the old events back and handle toxicity better with a newer punishment system. also the cleint fix it please"
Better honor rewards
"I don't think its possible with how riot runs LoL in general. With mostly everything being automated [Matchmaking] [Report system] [Support tickets for general inquiries] & the lack of DEV interest in the community as a whole as they continually put out empty patch after empty patch with unjustified buffs. "
Voice communication and giving the teammates of a feeder (intentional or unintentional) something to show for their decent work. Something to allow players to be given small rewards for their rank/queue quality (not meanignless cosmetics) even if they lose due to something not in their control.
Punish toxicity
people need to demote twice as easy as they get promoted
the game is beyond repair
It's bad at low ELO but gets progressively better. There's a pocket of toxicity at D4 because the skill gap is wide between D4 players.
remove any kind of penalties
"Balance team has to balance the game to make it fair, and stop with overloaded champions"
Reduce the overall damage.
"reduce toxicity "
"I think that every competetive game is full of toxicity even in WoW you find plenty of them and WoW is not so competetive. The difference is that in other games players get ultimately punished here they cant cuz you would be playing 4v5 that's why the punishment cant be instant. Anyway, I think ppl are exaggerating this topic. Srsly look around, ppl wont change they are vulgar every day It's just up to you how you r gonna react and make yourself immune to this. "
"It’s a very hard and long process. It’s just a circle of hate that’ll never stop and keeps on breeding more. The only way to is change ourselves, and be the better person and not be apart of the hate. Then we’ll attract and find others who think the same. We can’t change people but we can change ourselves and surround ourselves with positive people as well."
"Punishments should be harsher (as in they take effect quicker). Any toxic behaviour should be zero tolerance, especially in a game where you don't know what effects your words would have on the other person (or if you just don't care). Punishments should not be based on consistency of behaviour. In theory, you can be extremely toxic in one game, have a cooldown period, and not be punished. Punishments should feel they are warranted and immediate, not that they can be avoided if you balance your toxicity over a period of time."
"I feel that trolls/afk's are worse the verbally toxic player, for one can mute such toxico person, but can do nothing against a troll"
"Remove botlane from the game, and make it a 3v3"
chat restrict everyone to some degree.
Make better tutorials and guides for league.
Tougher punishment system on griefers.  Ragers are not an issue... there is a mute button.
Reporting system needs a total overhaul. Lets not go into details why unless you want a whole essay xd
riot should promote positive behavior
"Improving the environment is possible, but extremely difficult to get right. Most likely the technology for detection of toxic behavior isn't advanced enough yet to make meaningful progress. Optimally, players should receive instant feedback if they're displaying toxic behavior."
"Don't censor people cause that's a rabbit hole with no end, just give players the ability to turn off what they don't like"
"Harsher punishments for toxicity. "
"HAHA what? Riot won't do sh*t. We can all hope, but unfortunately we know the truth. They're wayyyyy beyong listening. (See: ETERNALS)"
It would make for a much better experience while playing LoL
this game is unfixable so all i can do is pray
"I wish people would stop flaming and tryharding so much in normal games especially, it just makes the ""fun"" environment super toxic and unhealthy and makes other people play worse. "
idk
none
Harsher punishment/IP Bans
"Fix matchmaking, end the damage and mobility creep. Stop reverting good decisions, bring back fun game modes, stop the cashgrab 'events'."
Remove bans for regular trash talk and uncensor because these snowflakes need to learn to grow a pair of balls
"Ban the guys who int and dont listen to the team and the person who is carrying. I dont care about flame. Riot should make the game fun again like season 3-4. "
more strect punishments
Return the game from Tencent :)
I Dont know where to start to be honest :/
"It is a good idea to pursue. "
"none, you cant erradicate the toxic behaviour in a competitive game"
Ban toxic people
"Its a must to keep the game alive "
Fuck eternals FIX YOUR CLIENT WE CANT PLAY WHEN WE LAGGIN
Improve game balance and matchmaking
lets make league a better place!!
"i dont really know what this question's trying to ask me, chief"
"Making a system like CSGO has where a player above a certain rank can review games which had people reported and enough consensus on bad behavior will punish the person who was toxic, AFK'd, etc."
idk
Quicker escalating punishments / More human reviews / Less lenient auto-punishments
Remove lootboxes
more incentive not to be toxic
A better punishment system. A very strict system. People should be afraid to say 1 bad thing in game. And people that say nothing in game but are clearly trolling or afk should be punished too!
"Issue more frequent bans on trolls, not aggressive typers. Consider making champs less frustrating to face. Have lane not lost after 1 mistake amd reduce snowball."
Improving it would be nice. Toxicity tilts people.
you cant really improve it by using toxic filters. you could fix it by fixing the game and not powercreeping the game that makes people very toxic. so its on devs for me
"Listen to players, learn your roles properly *jungle*, dont remove modes like TT and NB"
"Need a better balance between defense and offence. "
"Harsher bans, a written test for each rank so if they don't follow it they are trolling, punishing people who int more often"
"It's never gonna get better unless there is extremely heavy censorship and harsh punishments, but even then this is just the way online gaming is, not gonna change"
I've only extremely rarelly had a problem with toxicity. People are definitely overblowing's LoL problem. It's fine as it is and a good environment starts with yourself anyways.
"Nerf damage creep and assassins specifically, if they can't carry games, the toxic players will leave."
"People are naturally tryhard, because they want to see a miracle happen. Yet it comes at the expense of enjoyment in the game. Victories and Defeats are losing their connection to how fun the match is. Thus, it comes down to if the player wants to play or not, and making the game more enjoyable for people who perform well all comes down to surrender. The current surrender system is painfully democratic. A player who is 20/0/10 should have more weight than a player who is 0/10/0 when it comes to surrender. If there is a large kda difference, between any two allies, then the player with the best kda will act as 2 votes for surrender. Typically the stalemate for surrender is 3 yes and 2 nos, and this annoys people greatly. It is a significant cause for afk, griefing, and harassment. If impossible surrender can be avoided by performance, it forces players to improve their relationship with a player who performs well. It is also democratic enough to prevent the scenario of an overperforming player wanting to quit for something as silly as getting bored."
riot's ban system is  non sense and expects you act like a robot in a toxic enviroment
Human stupidity cannot be improved unfortunately. The way that LoL is build encourages this toxic behavior. So I have low expectations
"better balance team "
more gaming
Having a less toxic community is a good start.
A harsher Ban system might be effective
"Ban Trolls and feeders in my opinion if you feed three games or more in ranked and dont stop to practice in Norms you are trolling and calling your teammates bad should be fine it releases the anger and allows you to focus on playing better knowing that they know you are bad in my opinion "
"Honestly matchmaking needs a hard overhaul, the way that they have averages right now don't really work out when one player is significantly lower/higher than the rest of the groups"
"Better balance, stricter banning"
No chat at all
riot needs to focus on making the game more fun instead of out of game bs like TFT animals and the new champ specific progress systems
Firing all the devs and hiring completely new ones with enthusiasm toward the game.
"Banning trolls and griefers "
Reports don’t seem to do anything
"Focus more on the game instead of making money. Give us the gamemodes that we enjoy: URF, One for all, PVE modes etc. Make better quality skins and for the all the champions not on just the popular champions. The list is massive"
Is it even possible anymore?
"Put more effort into dealing with toxic players in a fair way, not just ban everyone thay breaks your chat filer or defends themselves."
Fixing damage and balance issues
"add mic, reduce toxicity requirements ( dont ban for toxicity ) and focus actual trolling and inting"
needs to be less stressful
ONLY ALLOW ALIENS TO PLAY.
Flaming should be fine. Leaving the game should be more easily bannable.
Make phone # verification required to play
start banning bad players from ranked and lower overal dmg it gets frustrating to get 1-shoted again and again cuz certainlyT jsut had to remain employed
"i think it would be an unconditionally good decision, although it might be less funny with friends if there's no odd allchat flame (I.E. i saw someone randomly type to a friend ""orphan"" off a misplay, i've laughed at enemies calling me an ape/clown when i fail, etc) but that's understandably dislikable"
"If we can’t fix balancing, at least fix the toxicity."
"Get rid of oneshot meta, bring back strategy, make baron tankier and harder to take, get rid of new runes and bring back old runes and masteries, reset rank ladder, etc."
"I'll be nearly imposible to achieve with the current punishing system and the fact that multiple accounts are allowed. I guess many of those players are bullying from their secondary account (aka smurf accounts), where even if they get banned it won't hurt. This is also one of the root causes why the game isn't approachable for newbies."
Enhance the communication hotkeys so that typing isn't necessarily required to communicate. Use the new communication systems allow for the removal of in-game chat and allow players to talk AFTER the game to discuss.
It's shit but that's online gaming in general.
Yes please
needs more nexus blitz I unno
nothing can be done because riot is a bunch of idiots
"Unless Riot can somehow un-buy themselves from Tencent, the game is fucked. It doesn't matter what ""improvements"" they make."
"Champ balance, more features, less money scamming tactics"
"i dont use chat anymore cause it only gets you in trouble but it's the only way you can explain a toxic player why it's not ok to do what he does, or understand why he does it, we can only let them do what they want and suffer in silence, this is not ok!.....we need to be able to discuss in game,since people can mute people who wanna chat if they wanna focus more on playing but now it's use chat=risk losing honor lvls"
Reduce frustration within the game somehow
Less leniency on those who actively and aggressively try to make the game a more hostile environment.
Putting more work on punishing toxic players
"Have people run the report system "
"Matchmaking needs to be checked, and reporting system improved. There are a lot of false positives, but something could be done about the actually NEGATIVE players. Bad Players are fixed by the matchmaking revision"
Put in more game modes
STOP buffing champs to sell skins.
better player banning system
Better detection of micro-negative attitude that ruin games and a better punishment system
better matchmaking
Kids being watched more by their parents would help without question. Unwarrented insults being thrown out by them without any parental control is out of hand.
Reduce damage and CDR.  Increase defenses.  Reduce true damage.  Buff turrets.
riot isn't doing anything to improve the game
ban bad players
impossible for a company like riot
I think a prisoners' island for repeated offenses would work.
More alerts
"dont let dog players play the game just people with a full brain "
It’s a difficult but plausible goal
change matchmaking system
Harsher unforgiving punishments
"It's hard to do with a free to play game where all you need is an email address you can randomly make from an abundant of sites. "
I dont know
"Take more time to listen to the playerbase and make changes based on what the majority wants. "
reducing overall damage
"Riot needs to bring back the tribunal first of all. Being judged by your peers is better than being judged by a robot or a company, i feel the game was a lot less toxic when the tribunal was around. Second of all, they need to balance the game to a healthier state because a lot of players are toxic because of how unfair it feels to play against certain champs or team comps. Lastly, there need to be harsher punishments for those that verbally abuse or attack others, especially for race or gender discrimination. First offense shouldn't be a warning, it should be harsher to discourage it even on a once in a blue moon bad day. "
"Have very decent reporting and punishment systems, maybe have more interaction with the community, or better yet fix the game currently so that people maybe are a bit happier and not bitter,sour,salty, etc."
Adopt inclusive practices like accessibility options and positive social environments.
no
Better balance and less toxicity
"Clean up the MMR, people don't belong where they are"
"I feel that Riot are way too generous in terms of letting bad behavior go unpunished. Soft inting goes undetected and win trading is still very common in high elo. As long as you don't use certain trigger words, or make your inting/trolling too obvious, toxic players can generally fly under the radar and avoid any significant punishment. The company should also put more effort into rewarding non-toxic players. The honor 5 capsule rewards are a joke."
"A ""Self Mute for reminder of current game"" button would go a long way in preventing some interactions."
"I came from Dota 2, so toxicity there was the norm. People can stop being so thin skinned and also the real bans need to happen to people who ruin the games, such as trolls and inters."
"STOP MAKING/REWORKING CHAMPS WITH OVERLOADED KITS, MAKE A MALHPHITE JESUS"
more bans for inters
Pretty much impossible
"Less nerfs on champions, more solutions for bugs, crashes, etc."
I think we can imporve the gaming environment by having a better report system instead of a bot controlled report system that detects key words rather than looking at the context of the situation.
"I doubt its really possible, but it would be so nice if it were possible."
Giving players more options to adjust/turn off
"Needs a lot of work, I think people that goad others, trying to get them angry, are more toxic than people who just vent frustration. "
"find something to do with excessive Blue Essence other than more rune pages, toxic players dont bother me, they are just retards"
"It should be a top priority. Homogenizing where the community voices their opinion should also be a priority, then having active Riot interaction with the community."
"Riot should give clearer feedback when reports lead to punishment, so people feel like Riot is doing something. There also needs to be extensive work done on detecting players who have so much experience with the game that they can throw a match while not appearing to throw it. (Soft-inting)"
"Fire ghostcrawler/Meddler/CertainlyT - that will allow the balance team to do their job and balance the game so it isn't so frustrating that people end up taking it out on each other.  Tougher punishments, as well."
people should stop worrying about others and think about themselves
have clear rules and an effective punishment system
"The best thing that could happen is the removal of the damage meta, i don't mind it but it seems like it irks people the most"
More clarity surrounding punishments & preventing people from Mass producing accounts
"It's...going to be tough. A lot of it relies on players simply getting fed up with toxicity and saying ""enough of this shit"", then developers responding."
meh
"Riot needs to implement an overwatch system, no one has afraid to int or be toxic anymore because there is nothing stoping them"
"Stop banning effect(toxicty) and start banning the cause (Trolling, Griefing, Win-trading,Intentionally feeding)"
Buff singed
Getting a more friendly environment results in a better gaming experience
More human interaction into the report system.
"Toxic players arent really affecting the game that much, its definitely more the meta and balancing that needs improvement"
"Bring back tribunal that shit took out the soft inters "
yes?
"If it's just league, fire the accursed balance team."
"Probably Impossible as long as the game stays competitiv, people generally dont like to admit mistakes, not everyone looks at the game the same way so certain decisions can be judged as trolling/playing ""incorrect"" by other players."
More attention to banning trolls
"Wishful thinking, but I support the effort "
Release the game before Yasuo came out in a legacy state.
"Ban people who are actually idiots. Ranking system is so annoying, with the Mr and such. Stop allowing weaker players play with better people, then they end up realising they are out of depth and choose to troll."
eh most likely wont happen
Hf :D
"League of Legends has always been plagued by toxicity, it's an everyday occurance. When it comes to trolls there is not much one can do, so I would like to implement a way to kick players and perhaps have them be controlled by AI or teammates, much like in CS GO. Sure, it might not work flawlessly and would still result in a loss, but it would give players a way to win games they would otherwise lose. Every player counts in a team game."
Nice
Needed
"Well they need to change up everything, from their stupid report system, to the horrible meta force they do every now and then. People Feed or troll if it doesnt go their way and dont get punished but if u say one bad word to them, that hurts that little snowflake u insta get reported and punished while he ruins everything for 4 other players, but all in all after all these years with the Meta forcing they do, toxic trash community and overall how bad the game has become i got no hopes no more, the community is trash just like the Developer and there is nothing that we can do"
"fuck sjw losers who want to enforce good behaviour with an iron fist. in my honest opinion, any and all forms of speech should not be able to be restricted by any private entity, just like how the government cant. so i think good behaviour should be encouraged, and bad behaviour should NOT be punished by anything other than society"
"accounts need to be not anonymous, and limited to one per player. You fuck up and get banned, you're just DONE with this game."
hard to improve
"Less cash grab, better balance team"
"Even if it is impossible to remove toxicity, it is best for everyone if everybody (both players and Riot Games in particular) worked together to actually push/make ideas to lessen toxicity "
Less toxicity
"almost impossible unless accounts get linked with SSN or the likes, but even then toxicity will still be prevalent. anonymity allows that"
Improving the banning system would be great
nerf akali and qiyana
"Unnecessary "
"Need to be harsher on punishments for people intentionally trolling since that's the most toxic thing, words I can easily ignore but inting will just ruin my mood"
"Harsher punishment, and stricter control on existing rules. "
more efficient bans for toxic/trolling people. Banning of smurf.
"Implement opt in voice chat. Punish consistently bad players harsher in ranked. "
Opt-out voice chat
Mute toxic people instead of banning
"Better detection of misbehavior. Increased regulation of smurfing. Optional voice comms in client. "
if the jungler messes up my lane I should be allowed to afk
"Improving gaming environment is always a good thing to see, but in my honest opinion there is no way to improve environment without players themselves accepting frustration (which is the only reason one becomes toxic) - an emotion that is a key to improvement both mentally and physically."
throw the toxic players away just ban them
